# 1. CashTrace : The Forensic Vision

CashTrace is a developer-centric forensic tool and indexer that converts complex multi-hop BCH transactions into human-readable visual graphs.

## The Problem : The UTXO Black Box

Tracing funds on BCH is uniquely difficult:

- A single transaction may contain dozens of outputs  
- Peel chains require manual tracking  
- Attackers can obscure stolen funds  
- Developers struggle to debug complex token minting flows

## The Solution : Automated Visual Forensics

### Recursive Crawler
Users input a **transaction hash or address**, and the system automatically crawls every subsequent movement of that value.
